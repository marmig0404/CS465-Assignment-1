# Kettering University - CS465 Winter 2022 - Assignment 1

## Project Requirements

- Design and implement a simple IR system.

- The system should:

  - Create the inverted index (the dictionary and postings lists) for your collection of documents

  - Parse and execute simple queries

  - Perform simple tokenization and normalization of the text such as removing digits, punctuation marks, etc.

  - Statistics:

    - Report the number of distinct words observed in each document, and the total number of words encountered.

    - Report the number of distinct words observed in the whole collection of documents, and the total number of words encountered.

    - Report the total number of times each word is seen (term frequency) and the document IDs where the word occurs (Output the posting list for a term).

    - Report the top 100th, 500th, and 1000th most-frequent word and their frequencies of occurrence.

    - Create postings and assign a term frequency to every document in postings list.

    - Provide a simple GUI to test the system.
